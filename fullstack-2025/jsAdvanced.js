/*refactor program
Format the program by following these rules:

Each variable should be defined in a new line using a let or const keyword.
Modify variable names so that they follow the camelCase style. Make sure they are short and meaningful, e.g.:
nameofaperson --> userName;
neweventgetfromserver --> newEvent;
thedateofthenewevent --> eventDate;
eventtextfrommessage --> eventMessage.
Place a single space before and after =;
Make sure all variables are properly formatted, e.g.:
elonmusk --> Elon Musk;
сreatedAnewCar --> created a new car;
2019,10,10 --> 2019.10.10.*/
const userName = 'Elon Musk';
const newEvent = 'created a new car';
const eventDate = '2019.10.10';
const eventMessage = `${userName} ${newEvent} in ${eventDate}`;
