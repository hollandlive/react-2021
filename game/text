1. I create a matrix of 9 numbers for 9 cells 
   from 0 to 9 - game field

const boardGame-[0 - 8];

2. computer chose a random cell = gives a number

var - rnd[0 - 8];

function randomCell(poppedBoardGame)

3. computer should fill the chosen cell with either an X or an O:
3.1 decision: computer will always start(another option: user can start)
3.2.decision2: computer will always start with X(another option: he can fill with 0)

3.3 -> find cell that matches the number chosen

function findCellById [0 - 8]

3.4 -> set its value to X

function setCellValue [x-- - 0]

3.5 remove cell(number) that has been used

function popTheLastElement 

boardGame.pop();

let boardGame = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
let poppedBoardGame = boardGame.pop();


4. Game switch to the player(me) turn

function swithcGame()

repeat step 1
    -> with poppedBoardGame  


SIMPLE LEVEL - NO EXTRA LOGIC FOR COMPUTER -

    repeat step 2
repeat setp 3.3
repeat step 3.4
repeat step 3.5
repeat step 4
